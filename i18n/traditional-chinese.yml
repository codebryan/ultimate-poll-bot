  poll_type_help: |
    Current poll type: *%{poll_type}*

    👍 *Single Vote:*
    Every user gets a single vote. The default and normal voting mode.

    📅 *Doodle:*
    Users can vote for `yes`, `no`, or `maybe` for each option. Great for finding a date.

    🎮 *Block Vote:*
    Every user can vote for all (or less) options. Useful for finding the most wanted options in a group, e.g. games that should be played on a LAN-Party.

    🎮 *Limited Vote:*
    Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute, but only once per option.
    Pretty much like block vote, but people need to prioritize.
    This mode is good for limiting the amount of possible winners e.g. if you only want max 4 games on your LAN-Party.

    📊 *Cumulative Vote:*
    Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute as they like (even multiple votes per option).
    This mode has a little more depth than limited vote, since it allows users to vote on a single option multiple times.

    🛒 *Unlimited votes* (or the shopping list) 😎
    Every user can vote as often on any option as they want.
    This is great if you want to, for instance, determine how much stuff everyone wants for the next festival trip.

    Hello there!

    My name is Arne Beer (@Nukesor). I'm the sole developer of the Ultimate PollBot.

    The idea of writing the Ultimate PollBot was formed, when my friends couldn't decide again where we should go for lunch.
    This happened so many times already and we desperately needed a good and stable solution inside of telegram for this problem!
    That's how the ULTIMATE PollBot was born.

    Every line of code in this project was written in my leisure time and is completely for free.
    This project is non-profit, open-source on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) and hosted on a server I'm renting from my own money.

    Right now I usually invest between 2-10 hours a week into developing and maintaining my projects and I would love to get some support, since I'm doing this in a large part for you out there.

    I really appreciate anything that helps me out and that keeps my server and me running ☺️.

    If you like this project, check out my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nukesor) or support me via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/arnebeer).
    If you have any questions, stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).

    Have great day!
  start: |
    🌟Welcome to the *ULTIMATE* PollBot 🌟

    Just type /create or click the button below to start creating polls. Everything is explained underway.

    🌐 You can pick another /language 🌐
    ❓Click /help for more explanations ❓

  help:
    intro: |
      There are quite a few settings for your polls.
      Just pick the category you're interested in or just read everything 😉.

    creation: |
      🌟*Creation:*

      To create a new poll, just write or click /create.
      For each poll you can specify several initial settings

      *Poll type:* The various types are explained in detail in the poll type menu.
      *Anonymity:* You can anonymize your poll, which results in no names being displayed! This is permanent and for all parties.
      *Visible results:* In this mode, votes only become visible after closing the poll. This is great to avoid the possibility of [tactical voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting) and the influence of [Anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring)

      -> *Attention: A closed poll with invisible results stays closed!:*
      Reopening a poll would allow a user, specifically the poll creator, to look at the votes, and place his own vote in a manner, that would result in a possible advantage for him (tactical voting).

    settings: |
      ⚙️ *Settings:*

      Further settings of a poll can be adjusted after the poll has been created:

      *Anonymity:* A poll can be made anonymous retrospectively.
      *Percentage:* The percentage line of options can be hidden in the settings menu.
      *Options:* New options can be added and existing options can be removed in the settings menu.
      *User Options:* You can allow other users to add options to your poll.
      *Order:* The order in which user names and options are displayed in the results can be changed.
      *Due date:* A due date at which the poll will be automatically closed can be set.

    notifications: |
      📣 *Notifications:*

      If you enable notifications for your chat, the bot will send a message 1 day, 6 hours, and 1 hour before the poll closes.
      This is just a feature to remind everyone in a group that a poll will close soon, and to make it easy to find the poll message again 😉.

      To enable notifications in a chat follow these steps:
      *1.* Create a poll
      *2.* Set a due date in the settings menu
      *3.* Go to the chat you want to be notified (The pollbot needs added to the group, before the poll is shared or you need to share it again)
      *4.* Reply with /notify to the poll message you selected via @ultimate\_pollbot
      *5.* Pick the correct poll

      This whole procedure is unhappily overly complicated, since telegram doesn't allow to detect messages from bots in groups 😐.
      Thereby we don't know which poll is posted in which group and everything needs to be done manually.

    management: |
      🕰 *Find old polls:*

      There are two commands /list and /list\_closed, which allow you to find and manage your old polls.


      ⚠️ *Delete polls:*

      You can delete individual polls in the respective poll menus.
      There's also the /delete\_closed command, which deletes all closed polls and the /delete\_all command which deletes ALL polls.

    languages: |
      🌐 *Language:*

      Ultimate pollbot supports multiple languages, but only English is officially maintained.
      To add a new language, go to the Github repository, copy the `english.yml`, rename it to your language and adjust all values.
      Be careful to not fuck up any Markdown styling (`**`, `__`, `${}`), otherwise stuff will break for your language.
      If anything breaks, because of broken translations, please fix it on your own. I will not investigate these issues.
      The multi language support is a community driven feature I happily support, but I cannot support multiple languages on my own.

    bugs: |
      *Known Bugs:*
      *1.* Polls with too many votes don't update anymore. This is due to telegrams limitation of 4096 characters per message. A fix is in progress. The current workaround is to make the poll anonymous and thereby reduce the length of the message.

      ⚠️ *There is an unknown bug that won't go away!!* 😩

      I usually get a notification as soon as something breaks, but there might be some bugs that go unnoticed!
      In case a bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).

  error: |
    An unknown error occurred. I probably just got a notification about this and I'll try to fix it as quickly as possible.
    In case the bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).
